Here is some useful rules to survive os212

1. [Read every reading assignments, your life will be blessed](#) 
Reading every chapters on the assignments would make us understand the foundations of what we learn about OS

2. [Try Demos.](#)
The demos file included with various problems we could explore to understand the concept of os programming

3. [Try Prev Midterm Problems]()
If you see the previous midterm problems, you would agree with me that it seems too hard :-(. But once we explore more and try to solve with gsgs and asking asdos/dosen, our life would be easier
