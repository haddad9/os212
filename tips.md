Here is some useful rules to survive os212

1. [Read every reading assignments, your life will be blessed](#) 
Reading every chapters on the assignments would make us understand the foundations of what we learn about OS

2. [Try Demos.](#)
The demos file included with various problems we could explore to understand the concept of os programming

3. [Try Prev Midterm Problems](#)
If you see the previous midterm problems, you would agree with me that it seems so hard for us to solve. So trying to solve it would make us have a better understanding about the subject on a current week

4. [CLASS ATTENNDING](#)
DO, NOT, EVER, SKIP THE CLASS. read that again. this is so important for you to understand various confussing subject of the OS class. take the advantage of attending ecery single week  of your class and ask everything you dont understand about the subject(of course you've read the subject and not gsgs-able question ).

5. [Scele Forum Quiz](#)
Maximize your weekly score by reply to Mr.RMS questions on scele forum about OS 

6. [Do not ever think you can speedrun LFS](#)
Once the LFS-chapters approcahes,I  would like to inform you of the following:
	1. LFS is not something you can speedrun. (even if you have an AMD Threadripper or Intel Core-X)
	2. I recommend you to read the LFS 11 Book [https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/11.0/], as debugging without understanding it is hard.
	3. Please, pay attention. LFS is not hard as long as you read the instructions carefully!

7. [Do not ever think you can speedrun LFS](#)
Maximize your score at the very beginning stage so you can quit early at the last semester.

8. [Maximize your score at the very end](#)
Final score will be graded grom highest 9 weeks score, so if you found your score not well enough, pursue it at the last week.
