# LINKS
#### These are links I *(and you,**probably**)* would regularly open to help me simplify my life studying operating system in daily basis. here we go!

1. [OperatingSystemConcepts10th.PDF !](https://ia801902.us.archive.org/28/items/operating-system-concepts-10th/operating-system-concepts-10th.pdf)<br>
This is the most important suplement. Well,  I know Mr.RMS give [this](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/) link but seriously every documents that cant be searched is sucks. this link allows you access the full pdf for Operating System Concepts 10th that used in reading assignments. *(also, you will unlock such a  power granted by the **ctrl+f**)*

2. [SOON !](https://translate.google.com/?hl=id&sl=ja&tl=id&text=soon&op=translate)<br>
Another links will be updated as soon as we will enjoy this journey on the next couple weeks, GREETS !
