# LINKS
#### These are links I *(and you,**probably**)* would regularly open to help me simplify my life studying operating system in daily basis. here we go!

1. [OperatingSystemConcepts10th.PDF !](http://edclap.com/mod/resource/view.php?id=1445&forceview=1)<br>
This is the most important suplement. Well,  I know Mr.RMS give [this](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/) link but seriously every documents that cant be searched is sucks. this link allows you access the full pdf for Operating System Concepts 10th that used in reading assignments. *(also, you will unlock such a  power granted by the **ctrl+f**)*

2. [Guide to Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org)<br>
Markdown is some powerful yet simple scripting. this website is an open-source reference guide that explains how to use Markdown, the simple and easy-to-use markup language you can use to format virtually any document(this document also built because I read this website, truly recommended)

3. [REGEX but VISUALIZED](https://www.debuggex.com)<br>
 I have a difficulty to memorize regex or even visualize it on my head. This website will help you to visualize any regex pattern that you wrote.  

4. [Linux Command Cheatsheet](https://www.guru99.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet.html) <br>

5. [All U Need About FUSE](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html)
FUSE is a userspace filesystem framework. It consists of a kernel module (fuse.ko), a userspace library (libfuse.*) and a mount utility (fusermount).
This link is the docs for FUSE 101. it would give you usefull information about FUSE, and most importantly, it is *searchable*.

6. [SOON !](https://translate.google.com/?hl=id&sl=ja&tl=id&text=soon&op=translate)<br>
